<h2 class="nobreak" id="BIRD_MIGRATION">BIRD MIGRATION.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> migration of birds is a subject that has
excited the attention of naturalists of all nations
from very early times, and many theories have
been advanced to account for the mysterious
periodical movements that take place among the
feathered tribes, although it can hardly be said
there is one which fully explains these movements.
Some writers affirm that they are
entirely due to temperature; others, that they
are caused by a want of food; while others, again,
assert that they are traceable, within certain
limits, to a hereditary impulse which guides birds
in following lines of flight over seas where at one
time all was land.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that originally, birds,
like other animals, were actuated to a great
extent in their periodical shiftings by the main
considerations of food and temperature. As
familiar examples of this, we have only to
remember that species which are reared within
the Arctic Circle are compelled to quit their
birthplaces as soon as the brief summer is past—their
haunts becoming wrapped in snow, and
their feeding-grounds converted into a dreary
expanse of ice; while in our own country, every
one knows that swallows and other soft-billed
birds are obliged to leave us at the close of
autumn, and repair to climes where there is
not only greater warmth but abundance of insect
life, on which their subsistence depends.</p>

<p>Another theory, however, may be adverted to,
as showing the phenomena in a more suggestive
and poetical light—namely, that put forward by
the aged Swedish poet Runeberg, who believes
that birds, in undertaking their vast and toilsome
journeys, are solely influenced by their longing for
light. When the days become shorter in the
north, birds make up their minds to go southwards;
but as soon as the long northern days
of summer set in, ‘with all their luminous and
long-drawn hours,’ the winged hosts return to their
old haunts. There is evidently something in this
theory, because, in the case of the insectivorous
birds, there is little diminution of food in their
southern hunting-grounds to compel them to
seek a change; and even with regard to marine
birds, it seems quite possible that fishes and
other migratory creatures in the sea on which
they prey are influenced to a great extent by
some such impulse as this theory indicates. The
longing after light, moreover, is well exemplified
in imprisoned plants, which, though firmly rooted
in the ground, instinctively strain towards
the light, and spread upwards in search of an
outlet from the surrounding darkness. The
Swedish poet, therefore, may, after all, be nearer
the truth than some naturalists are willing to
allow.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the true theory, it is
certain that at the close of each summer, whether
it be within the Arctic Circle or in the temperate
region of Britain, where observations are now
being made, vast flights of birds are seen passing
southwards, and again in early spring proceeding
northwards, with unvarying regularity; and it
has consequently become a matter of considerable
interest to ornithologists, as well as to naturalists
at large, to record such observations as may help
to throw light upon the question as to what
species share in the general migration and how
their movements appear to be influenced.</p>

<p>In <i>Chambers’s Journal</i> for December 1876, a
suggestion was made that the light-keepers of
our lighthouses might be enlisted in the cause
of science by making notes of their observations
concerning birds and other animals, as by that
means new facts would certainly be added to our
stores of knowledge; and Messrs J. A. Harvie
Brown and John Cordeaux—two well-known
ornithologists—subsequently undertook of their
own accord the circulation of carefully prepared
schedules among the keepers of lighthouses
and lightships situated on the English and
Scottish coasts, with a view to investigate the
migratory movements of birds. The results,
which were both interesting and valuable, were
published in the <i>Zoologist</i> for 1880, but were
immediately thereafter reprinted in a convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">{482}</span>
form for reference. Subsequently, it was found
that the scheme was somewhat beyond the limits
of private enterprise, and application for aid was
therefore made to the British Association at its
meeting at Swansea, in the autumn of the same
year. This led to the appointment of a Committee
of Naturalists, whose Report, issued in
1881 (London: Sonnenschein and Allen), was
so encouraging, that when the Association again
met at York, a larger Committee was appointed,
and a wider interest given to the investigations
by their extension to the coasts of Ireland. A
subsequent Report on the migration of birds,
containing a mass of interesting information on
the points referred to, has recently been issued
as the work of this Committee; and judging
from its contents, it may reasonably be expected
that the results of such investigations will
become more and more important as the work
proceeds.</p>

<p>From the returns given by the light-keepers,
it would appear that birds, prior to crossing
the ocean, follow closely the coast-line in their
journeyings, and that during the two periods
named, a continuous stream passes to and from
their summer quarters, broken, it may be, by
a sudden change of wind or other vicissitude
of weather, and thus causing ‘throbs’ or
‘rushes,’ as they have been termed, but steady
as a rule—the hereditary impulse being too
powerful to admit of anything but a temporary
deviation or delay on these great highways of
migration.</p>

<p>It seems strange that while such movements
are taking place, persons resident but a few miles
inland may be unaware of the winged multitudes
that in this way pass within a short distance of
their homes. Yet a great deal of information
may be gathered by close observers who are
willing to visit the seacoast at daybreak about
the time the birds are on the move. The present
writer well remembers seeing large flights of birds
of different species arriving in early spring on the
shores of East Lothian for a succession of years.
Among these, the swallows were conspicuous even
at some distance out at sea, the main body passing
northwards in undeviating flight, while numerous
detachments left it and came landwards, to
people the haunts in the country which they
had occupied the previous year. The same was
observed in the case of wheatears, redstarts, and
golden-crested wrens—the last-named being particularly
interesting from their tiny size. Occasionally
goldcrests would come in great numbers,
and immediately on alighting, would flutter in
the morning sunlight among the rocks and walls
near high-water mark in search of insect prey,
paying no heed to the presence of any one
watching their motions. Again, in the autumn
months, buzzards, owls, and woodcock would
arrive simultaneously, and pitch upon the rocks
at low water, as if glad to touch the nearest
land; and even wood-pigeons (supposed by the
country folks to come from Norway), which
delight only in dense woods and fertile fields,
and which suddenly appear in vast numbers
in severe British winters, settled in crowds upon
the stony beach without any preliminary survey
of the ground. Observations like these can be
made on almost any part of the east of Scotland,
and it is gratifying to find them verified
in a remarkable degree by the returns from
the light-keepers, which not only show the closeness
with which birds follow the coast-line, but
also indicate the points of land from which they
speed seawards in their adventurous flight. Thus,
it is found that arrivals and departures take
place at Spurn Point and on the coast of Forfarshire—the
inference being, if the theory of
a former land-communication be true, that an
ancient coast-line must have extended east or
north-eastward probably from Holderness to
Southern Scandinavia and the mouth of the
Baltic. There is also reason to believe that
similar points of arrival and departure exist in
the north-east of Aberdeenshire, judging from the
occurrence of so many rare birds, whose presence
there at the migration season can hardly
otherwise be accounted for.</p>

<p>Among other interesting facts brought to light
by the present series of investigations we find
that, with very rare exceptions, young birds of
the year migrate some weeks <i>in advance</i> of
the parent birds, and that the appearance on
our coasts in autumn of many species, such as
the wheatear, fieldfare, redwing, hooded crow,
goldcrest, and woodcock, may almost be predicted
to a day. The punctuality, indeed, with which
certain birds return to us in the fall of the year
is remarkable—one species regularly taking
precedence of another according to the time
required for their self-dependence. Shore-birds
apparently reach this stage earlier than land-birds,
as it has been observed that the young of the
knot, gray plover, godwit, and sanderling—birds
which nest in very high latitudes, and are the
last of the migrants to leave in spring—are
amongst the first to come to our shores.</p>

<p>The most interesting of all the stations from
which returns have been sent is the small rocky
island of Heligoland, situated in the North Sea,
about forty miles from the mouth of the Elbe.
Here the tired wing of many a feathered wanderer
finds a resting-place. Lying almost directly
in the line of migration, the island has been periodically
visited by birds in incredible numbers,
many of them belonging to species of extraordinary
interest. Attracted by the lighthouse, which
occupies the highest point of the island, and
throws out on dark nights a blaze of light ‘like
a star of supreme brightness,’ many thousands of
birds of all kinds pitch upon its treeless surface,
where they have scarcely any shelter from the
weather, and where they become at once a prey
to the wants of the islanders, who capture them
in vast numbers, and use them as food. Mr Cordeaux,
in an interesting communication to the <i>Ibis</i>
for 1875, states, that on the evening of the 6th
of November 1868, three thousand four hundred
larks were captured on the lantern of the lighthouse
before half-past nine o’clock; and on the
same evening, subsequent to that hour, eleven
thousand six hundred others were taken—making
a total of fifteen thousand. For this holocaust
of these charming songsters, no words of deprecation
are strong enough, though their capture
was probably regarded as a lawful addition to
the larder of the captors, and probably such
visitations had been so regarded ever since the
lighthouse had begun to lure the poor creatures
to an untimely fate! In this way also, no doubt,
many a feathered rarity was consumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">{483}</span></p>

<p>Fortunately for science, however, this little
island has numbered amongst its resident population
an observer of rare intelligence, Mr H. Gätke,
whose leisure hours have been employed for nearly
thirty years in registering the occurrence of the
birds which have either made the rock a temporary
resting-place or been seen crossing it in their
migratory flight. Mr Gätke first visited Heligoland
as an artist; but having secured an official
appointment there, he afterwards made the island
his permanent home. During the interval, he
has collected and preserved with his own hands
upwards of four hundred species—a collection
containing examples of the avi-fauna of the four
quarters of the globe. Strange as it may appear,
birds have touched here whose proper homes are
wide as the poles asunder—birds from the burning
plains of India and the arctic lands of desolation.
The Far West, too, has contributed its land and
water birds; and from the barren steppes of
Siberia, tiny warblers have joined the moving
throng. As instances of the abundance of what
are called ‘British birds,’ mention may be made
of flights of buzzards numbering thousands which
passed over the island on September 22, 1881;
while flocks of equal numbers rested on the cliffs,
and a ‘great flight’ of hooded crows, which crossed
in the same direction. As for the starling—a bird
which has become extraordinarily plentiful in this
country during the last thirty years—it is referred
to as making its appearance in a ‘great rush,’
which no doubt accounts for a flock, recorded
some time afterwards as coming from the east, by
a light-keeper on the English coast, ‘estimated to
contain a million starlings, making a noise like
thunder, darkening the air.’ All these birds were
doubtless of Scandinavian origin, and had in the
case of each species travelled in a compact body
along the coast-line until they reached North
Germany, where they had to some extent become
broken up, many of the birds being induced to
alter their flight westwards in the direction of
the British coasts. As a natural consequence, the
earliest observers of their arrival in this country
would be the light-keepers at Spurn Head on
the Yorkshire coast; and the records from this
station show that the buzzards and hooded crows
at least, reached us from Heligoland in somewhat
less than twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Another important post of observation is the
lighthouse on the Isle of May, in the Firth of
Forth,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> from which one of the reporters has
obtained records of species of more than ordinary
interest, the intelligent keeper there having
sent him no fewer than seven closely filled schedules,
principally referring to autumn migrations.
Seventy-five species have already been identified
from this station; but in addition to these,
numerous entries refer to ‘small birds’ of various
descriptions, regarding which and other accidental
visitors, more will be known as the investigations
proceed, arrangements having been made for the
preservation and transmission to the mainland of
all the species that occur at the station. The
occurrence of the blue-throated warbler here—a
very rare bird in Britain—suggests the possibility
of other interesting forms being sent from
this locality.</p>

<p>In summarising the material received, the compilers
of the Report confess that the migrations
of seagulls are most erratic and difficult to
tabulate. In certain years, however, these are
unquestionably regulated by the movements of
the fish upon which they feed. The late Professor
MacGillivray has recorded that, in the
winter of 1837, a flock of seagulls computed
to contain not short of a million birds made
its appearance in the Firth of Forth; and it
must be within the recollection of at least one
of the reporters that in 1872-3 similar if not
even greater numbers visited the firth, the most
common species being the kittiwake and lesser
black-backed gull. In this memorable invasion,
unusual numbers of glaucous and Iceland
gulls made their appearance, birds of such note
among ornithologists as to be marked objects when
they do occur; and the entire assemblage was
suggestive of a migration controlled by the movements
of fishes—the waters of the firth being at
that time swarming with sprats. The ‘catches’
of the local fishermen were so heavy as to necessitate
their sale at a trifling sum per cartload
to the neighbouring farmers, for the purpose of
manuring their fields.</p>

<p>There is not much, we apprehend, to be gathered
from the appearance of skuas, petrels, long-tailed
or ice ducks (<i>Harelda glacialis</i>), and other species
whose haunts are exclusively marine, as their
occurrence inshore signifies in nearly all cases
continued rough weather at some distance from
land. There are no seafaring creatures, indeed,
that delight more in storms than ice-ducks and
petrels; for them, the huge green waves or
churned masses of foam have no terrors; they
are for the time being at home amid the wildest
waters—the petrels on the one hand flitting
silently over the turbulent billows, rising as they
advance, and falling in their wake with contemptuous
ease; the ducks, on the other hand,
careering aloft during a sudden blast, and sounding
their bagpipe-like notes, as if deriding the
war of elements. Very different is the experience
of the tender songsters that traverse the dreary
waste of waters; sorely tried in their powers
of flight, they are not unfrequently caught by
adverse gales and driven hundreds of miles out
of their course, to be finally swallowed by the
pitiless waves.</p>

<p>In connection with this subject, and as bearing
upon the question of former land-communications,
reference may be made to an extremely
interesting paper on the Migration and Habits of
the Norwegian Lemming, read before the Linnæan
Society of London by Mr W. D. Crotch
in 1876. In this communication, Mr Crotch
shows that the lemming, which is a small
rat-like animal, occurring in abundance in
many parts of Norway, assembles periodically,
although at irregular intervals, in incredible
numbers, and travels westwards until the seacoast
is reached; after which, on the first calm
day, the vast multitude plunges into the Atlantic
Ocean, ‘and perishes, with its front still pointing
westwards.’ Such a voluntary destruction in
the case of a single species is perhaps nowhere
else to be found in the history of migratory
animals, and it seems difficult to understand
how the annihilation of so many migratory
hordes through a ‘suicidal routine’ should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">{484}</span>
ultimately lead to their extinction. Mr Crotch
tells us that no survivor returns to the mountains;
indeed, so formidable is the migration
and its effects upon the poor fugitives, that
we are told by Mr Collett—a Norwegian naturalist—of
a ship sailing for fifteen hours through
‘a swarm of lemmings which extended as far
over the Trondhjems fiord as the eye could
reach.’</p>

<p>Mr Crotch rightly, we think, concludes that
land existed in the North Atlantic Ocean at no
very remote date, and that when dry land connected
Norway with Greenland, the lemmings
‘acquired the habit of migrating westwards for
the same reasons which govern more familiar
migrations.’ The inherited tendencies, therefore,
of this little creature are opposed to the so-called
instinct which impels quadrupeds as well as birds
to change their quarters in quest of food and
warmth, unless we conclude, with Mr Crotch,
that in the case of the lemming, such instinct
has persistently failed in its only rational purpose.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XL.—MADGE’S MISSION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> glow of happiness on Madge’s face seemed
to brighten even the gloomy atmosphere outside.
She had done something for Philip—something
that would not only give him pleasure in the
highest degree, but which he would regard as
an important practical service. For she had no
doubt that she would be able to convince Mr
Beecham of the groundlessness of all his charges
against Mr Hadleigh. Then the two men would
meet; they would shake hands; all the errors
and suspicions which had separated them would
be cleared up, forgiven, and soon forgotten in
the amity which would follow. How glad Philip
would be. She was impatient to complete her
good work.</p>

<p>Miss Hadleigh entered the room hurriedly.</p>

<p>‘Goodness gracious, dear, what charm have
you used with papa that you have kept him
so long with you? I never knew him stay so
long with anybody before.’</p>

<p>‘The only charm used was that the subjects
we had to talk about were of great interest to
us both,’ Madge answered, smiling.</p>

<p>‘Oh, how nice.—They concerned Philip? What
does he say?’</p>

<p>‘That we are not to pay attention to the
rumours until we have definite information from
Philip himself.’</p>

<p>‘Was that all?’ Miss Hadleigh was disappointed,
and her expression of curiosity indicated
that she was quite sure it was not all.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Madge softly, wishful that her
answer might have been more satisfactory to Miss
Hadleigh.</p>

<p>The latter did not endeavour to conceal her
surprise; but she did successfully conceal her
feeling of pique that Madge should have been
taken into the confidence of her father about
matters of grave moment: she was sure they
were so, for she had passed him on his way to
the library. <i>She</i> had never been so honoured.</p>

<p>‘I suppose I must not ask you what the other
subjects were, dear?’ she said, with one of her
most gracious smiles. She meant: ‘You certainly
<i>ought</i> to tell <i>me</i>.’</p>

<p>Madge was spared the necessity of making a
reply; for Mr Hadleigh, instead of sending the
promised packet, had brought it himself. When
he appeared, his daughter was silent. That was
generally the case; but on the present occasion
the silence had an additional significance. She
was struck by a peculiar change in his expression,
his walk, and manner. As she afterwards
told her betrothed, it quite took her breath away
to see him coming into the room looking as mild
as if there had never been a frown on his face.
The dreamy, seeking look had vanished from
his eyes, which were now fixed steadily on
Madge.</p>

<p>‘I have brought you the memorandum, Miss
Heathcote, and you are free to make what use
of it you may think best.’</p>

<p>‘I hope to make good use of it,’ was her answer
as she received a long blue envelope which was
carefully sealed.</p>

<p>‘Of course you understand that you are at
liberty to open this yourself, or in the presence
of others whom you think the contents
may affect.’</p>

<p>‘I shall first find one or two of the other
letters,’ said Madge, after a moment’s reflection,
‘and then I shall place them with this packet,
sealed as it is, in the hands of the gentleman it
most concerns.’</p>

<p>‘I am satisfied. What I am most anxious
about is that you yourself should be convinced.
Do not forget that.’</p>

<p>‘I am already convinced.’ No one could doubt
it who saw the bright confidence in her eyes.</p>

<p>‘That is all I desire; but of course it will be
a pleasure to me if you succeed in convincing
others. I have told them to have the carriage
ready, as I thought you might be in a hurry to
get home.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed I am; and thank you.’</p>

<p>Amazement as much as courtesy kept Miss
Hadleigh mute until the leave-taking compelled
her to utter the usual formalities. Mr Hadleigh
saw Madge to the carriage, and there was a note
of tenderness in his ‘Good-bye’—as if he were
a father seeing his daughter start on a long
journey from which she might never return.</p>

<p>What was the mysterious influence the girl
exercised over this man? Under it he had been
always different from what he appeared to be
at other times; and under it he had consented
to do that to which no one else, except Philip,
had ever dreamt he could be persuaded.</p>

<p>‘I shall be glad when they are married,’ he
repeated to himself as, when the carriage had
disappeared, he walked slowly back to the
library.</p>

<p>Aunt Hessy was somewhat startled when she
saw the Ringsford carriage and Madge come out
of it alone.</p>

<p>‘Is anything wrong at the Manor?’ she
asked; but before she had finished the question
she was reassured by the face of her niece.</p>

<p>‘No, aunt; but Mr Hadleigh thought I should
have the carriage, as I was in a hurry. I have
had a long talk with him. He has made me
very happy, and has given me the power to
make others happy.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">{485}</span></p>

<p>They were in the parlour now, and Aunt
Hessy smiled at the excitement of the usually
calm Madge.</p>

<p>‘Is it extra blankets and coals for the poor folk,
or a Christmas feast for the children?’</p>

<p>‘No, no, aunt: it is something of very great
importance to Philip and to me. Philip’s uncle
has all these years believed that it was Mr
Hadleigh who spread the false report about him;
and that is why he will not agree to have anything
to say to him. Now, Philip has set his
heart upon making them friends, and I can do
it!’</p>

<p>There was a brightness in the girl’s voice and
manner which Aunt Hessy was glad to see after
those days of pained thoughtful looks.</p>

<p>‘How are you to do that, child?’</p>

<p>‘By showing Philip’s uncle who the real traitor
was. His name was Richard Towers, and Mr
Hadleigh says you knew him.’</p>

<p>‘Richard Towers,’ echoed the dame gravely,
and looking back to the troubled time calmly
enough now. ‘We did know him, and we did not
like him. He was one of the worst lads about
the place, although come of decent people. He
borrowed money from my father, and thought
he could pay it back by wedding his daughter.
He would not take “no” for an answer for a long
time. But at last he came to see that there was
no chance for him, and he spoke vile words. I
do believe he was the kind of man that would
take pleasure in such evil work.’</p>

<p>‘He did do it. I have the proof.’</p>

<p>‘The wonder is we never thought of it before,’
continued the dame thoughtfully; ‘but he has
been gone away this many a year and is dead
now. He went to California, and was shot in some
drunken quarrel. Neighbour Hopkin’s lad, who
was out there too, says he was lynched for robbing
a comrade and trying to murder him. But these
are not pleasant things to talk about. God forgive
the poor man all his sins; although, if what
thou ’rt saying be true, he brought sorrow enough
to our door.’</p>

<p>That was the worst word the good woman had
for the man. Then Madge, without betraying
the confidence of Beecham, gave her a brief outline
of her conversation with Mr Hadleigh. Aunt
Hessy naturally concluded that it was Philip who
had suggested that she should speak to his father,
and asked no questions. With her mind full
of wonder at the way in which the wicked are
found out sooner or later, she went to the dairy
whilst Madge wrote a hasty note to Mr Beecham.
She asked simply what was the earliest hour at
which she could see him.</p>

<p>She gave the note to young Jerry Mogridge
with strict injunctions that he was to bring back
an answer, no matter how long he might have
to wait. Jerry promised faithful obedience, and
privately hoped that he might have to wait a
long time, for the taproom at the <i>King’s Head</i>
was a pleasant place in which to spend a few
hours.</p>

<p>Then Madge went to the garret, which had
been a storehouse of wonders to her in childhood,
for there the lumber of several generations was
stowed. It was a large place, occupying nearly
the whole length and breadth of the house, with
a small window at each end, and one skylight.
She knew exactly where to find the oaken box
she wanted, for she herself had pushed it away
under the sloping roof near one of the windows.
It was not a large box, and she had no difficulty
in dragging it forward, so that she had the full
benefit of the light. She had the key ready;
but as it had not been used for years, she found
it was not easy to get it to act. At length she
succeeded, and raising the lid, disclosed a mass
of old letters neatly tied in bundles, and old
account-books ranged in order beside them.</p>

<p>The letters were not only neatly tied but duly
docketed, so that, as Madge rapidly took out
bundle after bundle, she had only to lift the tops
to see from whom they had come and when.
The light was failing her fast, and Aunt Hessy
would on no account permit a lighted lamp or
candle to be brought into the garret. She
strained her eyes, and endeavoured to quicken
her search. At length she found two letters,
both dated in the same year—the year of her
mother’s marriage—and bearing the name Richard
Towers. With a breath of satisfaction she drew
them out from the bundle. What their contents
might be did not matter: all she wanted was
to secure fair specimens of the man’s handwriting.</p>

<p>After relocking the box and thrusting it back
into its place, she descended to the oak parlour.
The lamp was on the table, and she lit it at once.
Her first impulse was to open those letters and
read them. But that would be to no purpose, as
it was not in her power to compare the writing
with the memorandum in the blue envelope she
had received from Mr Hadleigh. Of course she
was at perfect liberty to open that too, and it
was natural that she should feel an inclination
to do so. This feeling, however, was brief. She
had decided to deliver the undoubted letters of
Richard Towers and the packet with its seals
unbroken. So she secured them all in one cover,
which she addressed to Austin Shield. It was
not to pass from her own hand except into that
of the person for whom it was intended.</p>

<p>She had not recovered from the sense of hurry
in which she had been acting, when young Jerry
returned, and after fumbling in his pockets, produced
a note.</p>

<p>‘You saw Mr Beecham, then?’ she said gladly.</p>

<p>‘Didn’t see him at all, missy; and I thought
maybe as I’d better bring that back.’ The note
he gave her was her own.</p>

<p>‘But I told you to wait.’</p>

<p>‘Weren’t no sort ov use, missy. Gentleman’s
gone away bag and baggage; and they say at the
<i>King’s Head</i> he ain’t a-coming back no more.’</p>

<p>‘Did he leave no address?’</p>

<p>‘No what, missy?’</p>

<p>‘The name of any place where letters could
be sent to him.’</p>

<p>‘O yes. I saw father: he drove him to the
station, and the gentleman’s gone to London.’</p>

<p>This was all the information young Jerry had
been able to obtain, and he regarded it as quite
satisfactory. To Madge, it was disappointing;
but only in so far that it delayed the completion
of her mission for a few days. It was certainly
strange that Mr Beecham should take his departure
so suddenly without leaving any message
for her; but she had no doubt that the post
would bring her one.</p>

<p>So, now, she settled herself down to wait for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">{486}</span>
Philip, and to make him glad when he came,
with her news that his father had given his
consent to the reconciliation.</p>

<p>But Philip did not visit Willowmere that
night.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> had the good fortune, some years ago,
to find myself in the grand old Indian land, in
company of friends so exceptional as still to
take keen interest in all matters relating to native
customs and Indian antiquities, I hailed with
delight their proposal that we should devote some
weeks to leisurely wandering among the chief
points of interest along the line of railway, and
thus with ease and comfort see more of the
country than many old Indians have explored
in their long years of exile. One of the chief
cities where we made a prolonged halt was
Allahabad—that is, ‘the City of God’—now the
point of junction for the railway from Bombay
and from Calcutta, but dear to the natives of
India as the meeting-place of the sacred rivers
the Jumna and the Ganges, and consequently
a very favourite place of pilgrimage, where
countless multitudes annually assemble from
every part of Hindustan.</p>

<p>Immediately above the junction of the sacred
rivers stands the old fort of Allahabad, a grand
mass of red sandstone, built by the great Emperor
Akbar. It now contains a very large English
armoury—great guns and little guns, and cannon
and mortars, and all manner of weapons. Here it
was that the English found refuge during the
Mutiny; and our friends showed us the balcony,
over-hanging the river, to which they thankfully
hauled up any morsels of food or firewood
brought to them by the faithful old servants,
whom, however, they had been compelled to
dismiss, with the rest of the native attendants,
from within the walls of the fort. The mutiny
in this city was very quickly crushed by the
timely arrival of General Neill with his ‘Madras
Lambs;’ not, however, till after one awful night,
when, the doors of the jails having been broken
open, three thousand miscreants were turned
loose to lend their aid in burning and plundering
the city. Upwards of fifty Europeans were
massacred that night, including eight young
cadets who had only just arrived from home.
In the centre of the fort stands a very remarkable
monolith, surmounted by a lion. It bears
an inscription in the ancient Pali character, and is
known as the Lat or Stone of Asoka, a mighty emperor
who lived about 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and who, having
embraced the tenets of Buddha, inscribed his
decrees on sundry great pillars which he erected
in divers cities. One of these is at the Buddhist
caves of Karli, and is called the Lion-pillar. It
is a sixteen-sided monolith, surmounted by four
lions. Another exists at Delhi, in the ruined
fort of Togluck, though it is called after Feroze,
a very modern emperor, whereas Asoka was, as
we have seen, a mighty prince of pre-Christian
ages. His pillars are sometimes surmounted by
lions, sometimes by human figures, overshadowed
by the seven-headed cobra, or some other emblem
of power, such as the mystic umbrella—symbolical
of Buddha—of which sufficient trace remains
to be recognised, though time and weather
have in the course of two thousand long years
worn away the distinct form. Very similar pillars
are at the present day erected in Nepaul, whereon
are placed statues of kings, sometimes shaded by
an umbrella made of metal—and in one instance,
by the serpent hood.</p>

<p>From the reign of Asoka, the stone architecture
of India dates its origin. He is said to have left
eighty-four thousand buildings of various sorts,
as the marks of his footprints on Time’s sands.
To him is attributed the great tope at Sanchi,
that mighty relic-shrine, whose huge stone portals
are to this day a marvel of mythological sculpture,
the details of which have now been made
so familiar to us all by casts, photographs, and
description (see Fergusson’s <i>Tree and Serpent
Worship</i>, and also the great plaster casts at the
South Kensington Museum)—sculptures representing
the primeval worship of sacred serpents
and holy trees, and displaying wheels, umbrellas,
and other symbols more particularly suggestive
of the new faith—that of Buddha—which Asoka
established as the religion of the state. This
mighty despot having determined that the new
maxims which had become binding on his own
conscience should henceforth be law to his subjects,
proceeded to inscribe them on stone in every
corner of his dominions, that the wayfarer might
read them for himself.</p>

<p>Thus it is that, besides finding his edicts
engraven on his buildings and pillars, they are
also found inscribed—as on imperishable tablets—on
great rocks scattered over the country
from Orissa to Peshawur. One of these huge
boulders, twenty feet in height and twenty-three
in circumference, lies in the lonely jungle in
the district of Kathiawad in Western India.
Here the emperor states, that being convinced
of the iniquity of slaying living creatures, he
will henceforth desist from the pleasures of the
chase. Henceforth, no animal must be put to
death either for meat or sacrifice; and this law,
which the emperor appoints for himself, is to
apply to all his subjects, who are in future to
feed only on vegetables. His protection of the
brute creation applies, not only to their lives;
medical care is to be provided for all living
creatures, man and beast, throughout the whole
empire, as far south as Ceylon. Wells were to
be dug, and trees planted, that men and beasts
might have shade and drink. The emperor forbids
all convivial meetings, as displeasing to the gods
or injurious to the reveller. He declares that
he will himself set the example of abstaining
from all save religious festivals. On this huge
‘Junagadh Rock,’ as it is called, allusion is also
made to four contemporary Greek kings. The
date thus obtained is proved to be about 250
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, which just corresponds with that of Asoka
himself.</p>

<p>The edicts go into various other matters. They
inculcate the practice of a moral law of exceeding
purity; they enjoin universal charity; and bid
all men strive to propagate the true creed. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">{487}</span>
this end, special missionaries were to be sent
forth to the uttermost parts of the earth, to preach
to rich and poor, learned and ignorant, that they
might bring those ‘which were bound in the fetters
of sin to a righteousness passing knowledge.’
Nevertheless, a liberal margin was to be allowed
for diversity of opinion, and nothing savouring
of religious persecution was to be tolerated. At
the same time, the domestic life of the people was
subject to the strictest censorship, overseers being
appointed to report on every act in the life of
every subject. These domestic inspectors attracted
the particular attention of the Greeks who visited
India in the train of Alexander the Great, who
first turned the attention of Europeans to the
then unknown Indian land, and pursued his
career of conquest as far as the banks of the
Sutlej, making himself master of the Punjab, and
establishing Greek colonies at various places.
These Greeks described the domestic monitors
as ‘Episcopi,’ and asserted that their duty was
to report, either to the king or the magistrates,
everything that happened in town and country—an
office which they seem to have filled wisely
and with discretion. We may here observe that
there must be some confusion in this chronicle of
ancient days, inasmuch as Alexander the Great
is stated to have died at Babylon in the year 323
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, a hundred years before the date usually
assigned to the death of Asoka.</p>

<p>But Asoka’s pillar has been to us as a talisman,
transporting us backward for twenty centuries,
to those remote days, which we now hear of as
a dream of the past, when Buddhism first arose,
and, like a mighty wave, for a while overspread
the whole land. Hinduism is now, however, the
chief religion of this north-west province.</p>

<p>The pillar is not the sole representative of
diversity of creed that exists within the huge
Mohammedan fort, a fort now held by Christians,
who have fitted up one of Akbar’s buildings as a
military chapel, where, we believe, service is held
daily. Half-way between this Christian church
and the Buddhist pillar there still exists a Hindu
temple of exceeding sanctity, though how the
Mohammedans came to tolerate its existence
within their fort is a marvel quite beyond comprehension.
It is a foul temple of darkness,
extending far underground, and roofed with low
arches. We descended by a flight of dark dirty
steps, dimly revealed by a couple of tallow
candles; and we followed the old soldier who
acted as our guide, and who led us along dark
passages, and did the honours of various disgusting
idols, stuck in niches, some as large as
life, others quite small, but all alike hideous,
and all adorned with flowers, and wet with the
libations of holy Ganges water, poured upon them
by the faithful. The flowers are the invariable
large African marigold and China roses.</p>

<p>Each image is generally smeared with scarlet
paint, to symbolise the atonement of blood that
should be offered daily, but which most of the
worshippers are too poor to afford. This substitute
for the sacrifice of blood is common all
over India, where a daub of red paint administered
to the village god is at all times an
acceptable act of atonement. These village gods,
however, are generally placed beneath some fine
old tree, with the blue sky overhead; but this
disgusting temple was one which you could not
enter without a shuddering impression of earthly
and sensual demon-worship.</p>

<p>Here we were also shown a budding tree, supposed
to be of extraordinary antiquity; a fiction
by no means shaken, though the Brahmins frequently
substitute a new tree. So holy is this
temple, that when, at one time, all natives were
excluded from the fort, one rich Hindu pilgrim
arrived, and offered twenty thousand rupees for
permission to worship here. The commandant,
however, had no authority to admit any one, so
was compelled to refuse his prayer, in spite of so
tempting a bait. It was with a feeling of
thankful relief that we emerged from that noxious
and oppressive darkness into the balmy air and
blessed sunlight.</p>

<p>We spent some pleasant hours in one of the
balconies overhanging the river, while in the
cool room within, fair women with musical voices
accompanied themselves on the piano, in Akbar’s
old quarters; and so we idled away the heat of
the day till the red sun sank into the water,
behind the great dark railway bridge, a bridge
which the Brahmins declared the gods would
never tolerate on so sacred a river as the Jumna,
but which nevertheless spans the stream in perfect
security. It was a vast undertaking, as, owing
to the great extent of country subject to inundation
during the rains, it was necessary to construct
a bridge well-nigh two miles in length. The
Indian railway has certainly necessitated an
amazing amount of work, on a scale so vast as
to test engineering skill to the uttermost, and in
no respect more strikingly than in the construction
of these monster bridges, one of which, across
the Soane, is about a mile and a quarter in length,
while that on the Sutlej, between Jellunder and
Loodiana, is about two and a half miles. On
the sandbanks just below the fort, huge mud-turtles
lay basking, and the gentlemen amused
themselves by taking long shots at them from
the balconies, whereupon the creatures rose and
waddled into the water with a sudden flop.
These sandbanks are favourite haunts of crocodiles—<i>muggers</i>,
as they are called—which, however,
declined to show on this occasion.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pleasantest of our afternoons at
Allahabad was one spent in watching the evolutions
of the native cavalry, Probyn’s Horse, a
beautiful regiment, whose graceful dress, and still
more graceful riding, were always attractive. On
this occasion they were playing the game of
Naza Bazi, or the Game of the Spear, when,
riding past us singly at full gallop, they with
their long spear split a wooden tent-peg driven
hard into the ground. Then they picked a series
of rings off different poles; afterwards, with
unerring sword, cleaving a succession of oranges,
stuck on posts, as though they were foemen’s
skulls. Next followed some very pretty tilting
with spear against sword. We had only one fault
to find—their strokes were so unerring that they
never allowed us the excitement of a doubt!
Altogether, it was the prettiest riding imaginable,
and a beautiful game, though the practice of
suddenly pulling up short, when at full speed, on
reaching the last peg, thereby showing off splendid
horsemanship, must often injure the good steed.
As we watched this beautiful sport, we all agreed
in wishing we could see it introduced into
England. That wish has since then been fulfilled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">{488}</span>
and I learn with pleasure that many of our own
cavalry have attained such perfection in this
game of skill as to be no whit behind the most
accomplished of Indian horsemen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A prisoner</span> had escaped from Dartmoor Prison.
During a dense fog, which had suddenly enveloped
a working convict-gang, one of them—a man notorious
for being perhaps the most desperate character
amongst the many desperate ones there—had
contrived to escape, and, for the present at all
events, had eluded capture.</p>

<p>It was not a particularly pleasant piece of news
for us to hear, considering that we had, attracted
by a very tempting advertisement, taken a small
house for the summer months not very far distant
from the famous prison itself. We were
tired of seaside places; it seemed as if we should
enjoy a change from our every-day life in London
more, if we were in some quiet secluded spot,
far from uncompromising landladies, crowds of
over-dressed people, and bands of music. Every
day we scanned the papers, with a view to discovering
something to suit us; and our patience
was at last rewarded by coming across the following
advertisement, to which I promptly replied:
‘To be let for the summer months, a charming
Cottage, beautifully situated on the borders of
Dartmoor, containing ample accommodation for
a small family, with every convenience; a good
garden and tennis-lawn; also the use of a pony
and trap, if required; and some choice poultry.
Terms, to a careful tenant, most moderate. Apply
to A. B., Post-office, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>The answer to my inquiries arrived in due
time; and everything seemed so thoroughly satisfactory,
that I induced my husband to settle upon
taking the place for three months, without a
personal inspection of it previously. The terms
were two pounds ten shillings a week, and that
was to include the use of the pony-trap, the
poultry, and several other advantages not set forth
in the advertisement. The only drawback—rather
a serious one—was that Mr Challacombe,
to whom the place belonged, had informed me
that it was about three miles from a station.
However, with the pony-trap always at hand,
even that did not seem an insuperable objection.
He expatiated upon the beauty of the scenery;
the perfect air from the heather-clad moors; and
lastly, requested an early decision from us, as
several other applicants for the Cottage were
already in the field.</p>

<p>To be brief, we agreed to take it; and on a
scorching day in July, our party—consisting of
two maid-servants, my husband, and myself, and
our only olive branch, a most precious little
maiden of three years old—started from Paddington
Station <i>en route</i> for Exeter, where we were
to branch off for our final destination, Morleigh
Cottage. The pony-trap was to meet us; and
Mr Challacombe had promised that we should
find everything as comfortable as he could possibly
arrange; and as sundry hampers had preceded
us, I had no fears as to settling down
cosily as soon as we should arrive.</p>

<p>The journey to Exeter by an express train was
by no means tedious; we rather enjoyed it. As
our branch train slowly steamed into the wayside
station, we seemed to be the only passengers who
wished to alight; and presently we found ourselves,
with the exception of a solitary porter,
the sole occupants of the platform. At one end
of it lay a goodly pile of our luggage, which
the said porter had in a very leisurely manner
extracted from the van.</p>

<p>The pony-trap was to meet us; and as Mr
Challacombe had assured us it would not only
hold four grown-up people and a child, but a fair
amount of <i>impedimenta</i>, we were under no anxiety
as to how we were to reach Morleigh Cottage.</p>

<p>‘Is there anything here for us?’ my husband
inquired of the porter.</p>

<p>‘No, sir; not that I knows of.’</p>

<p>‘From Morleigh Cottage?’ Jack explained.</p>

<p>‘No, sir,’ he repeated. ‘But chance it may
come yet.’</p>

<p>‘Chance, indeed,’ I echoed in a low tone. ‘It
will be too disgraceful, Jack, if Mr Challacombe
has forgotten to desire the carriage to be sent.’</p>

<p>We both proceeded to the other side of the
station, and gazed through the fast-falling twilight
up a narrow road, down which the porter informed
us the pony-trap was sure to come, if it was coming
at all—which did not seem probable, after a dreary
half-hour’s hopeless waiting for it.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, we beguiled the time by asking
the porter some leading questions with regard
to the surroundings, &amp;c., of Morleigh Cottage;
all of which he answered with a broad grin on
his sunburnt, healthy face.</p>

<p>‘How far is the Cottage from here?’ Jack
inquired.</p>

<p>‘Better than six miles.’</p>

<p>‘Six miles!’ I exclaimed!—‘O Jack, Mr
Challacombe said it was about three.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a good step more than that,’ observed the
porter, with a decided nod of his head.</p>

<p>‘It is a very pretty place?’ I said interrogatively.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t bad, for them as likes it,’ was the
guarded and somewhat depressing response.</p>

<p>I felt my spirits sink to zero. I had persuaded
Jack to take it; he had suggested that we should
go to see it first; but the advertisement had been
so tempting, and the idea of the other longing
applicants had made me so keen to secure it, that
I felt whatever it was like, I must make the best
of it, and contrive that Jack at least should not
repent of having been beguiled by me into, as he
expressed it, taking ‘a pig in a poke.’</p>

<p>‘The pony-carriage is sure to come,’ I said in
a confident way, once more straining my eyes up
the deserted road. As I uttered the word ‘pony-carriage,’
I detected a distinct grin for the second
time on the man’s face, which was presently fully
accounted for by the appearance of our equipage
coming jolting down the deeply rutted road.
Imagine a tax-cart of the shabbiest, dirtiest description,
with bare boards for seats, and the
bottom strewn with straw; the pony, an aged
specimen, shambling along, with a harness in
which coarse pieces of rope predominated. It
was a pony-<i>trap</i>, with a vengeance.</p>

<p>I could almost have cried when it drew up, and
I saw Jack’s critical eye running over all its shortcomings.
And it was all my fault.</p>

<p>It was too late to recede from our bargain
now; all that we could do was to bundle into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">{489}</span>
the horrible machine, and endure as we best
could an hour’s martyrdom driving to Morleigh
Cottage.</p>

<p>Our groom was a civil boy of about fifteen, clad
in ordinary working-clothes. He managed to
sit on the shaft or somewhere, and to drive us
back, as Jack of course had no idea of the direction;
and, judging from the solitariness of the
scene, we should not have been wise to depend
upon chance passers-by to direct us.</p>

<p>Arrived at last, we found the Cottage was just
two shades better than the trap. It was a tiny
abode, as desolately situated as it was possible to
conceive; the only redeeming point about it
being that it was clean.</p>

<p>The next morning, which happened to be a
very wet misty one, we surveyed our garden and
domain generally. The tennis-lawn was spacious
enough, and the garden, to do Mr Challacombe
justice, was well stocked; but the place itself was
like the city of the dead—so silent, so quiet, so
lonely.</p>

<p>But as the weather improved, we got out
most of the day, which rendered us very independent
of the small low-roofed rooms. Jack
and I took long walks, and occasionally we
utilised the pony-trap, taking with us our little
Rose and her nurse.</p>

<p>We began to think soon of asking some of our
relations to visit us; and the first to whom I sent
an invitation was an elderly cousin, who resided
in London, and who was in rather delicate health.
I candidly explained the out-of-the-way nature
of the place we were in, but descanted upon the
great pleasure it would be to have her, and my
entire conviction that the air would do her an
immense amount of good. She came; and it
was very fortunate for me that she did so, as
about three days after, a telegram had reached
us requesting my husband to lose no time in
returning to town, in consequence of one of his
partners being taken ill. It was raining when he
left us; and I watched the wretched shandrydan
disappear down the road with feelings I could
scarcely repress—a sense of foreboding evil seemed
to oppress me. I tried in vain to shake it off,
but only partly succeeded in doing so. Cousin
Susan endeavoured to console me by reminding
me constantly that Jack had promised to return
in a day or two.</p>

<p>Jack had just been gone for one week, when
Rose’s nurse, a pleasant girl of about twenty,
came to my room and informed me of the occurrence
I have already alluded to—‘A prisoner had
escaped.’</p>

<p>Nothing could have frightened me more, and
I was afraid it might alarm Cousin Susan,
so I charged Margaret on no account to let
it reach her ears. Very likely, even now the
man was captured; it was rare, indeed, that a
convict ever escaped; but I had heard stories
of their eluding capture, until, driven by sheer
starvation, they often surrendered themselves to
any stray passer-by, to whom the reward might
or might not be of some consequence.</p>

<p>That very morning, we had arranged to drive
to rather a distant spot to get some ferns. I
would fain have deferred the expedition; but
Cousin Susan was already preparing for it, so I
could only have postponed it by giving my
reasons; and the chance of encountering the convict
seemed too small to risk terrifying her by
telling her of it at all.</p>

<p>It was a lovely morning when we started,
and Cousin Susan became quite enthusiastic over
the ‘frowning tors and wind-swept moors.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you admire them, Helen?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘They are very grand,’ I admitted.</p>

<p>‘Oh, so lovely, so wild!’ said Susan.</p>

<p>I was glad she liked them.</p>

<p>The ferns were to be found in a sort of ravine,
which was reached by a narrow lane; on one
side was almost a precipice, overhanging a
streamlet, now nearly dry, but one which the
winter rains soon transformed into a torrent;
on the other side was a wood, composed principally
of stunted oak-trees, with hardly any
foliage, and singularly small; but all around the
trees was a thick sort of underwood.</p>

<p>We had left Tom the stable-boy with the trap
by the roadside, and I had privately resolved
not to let my cousin penetrate farther into the
ravine than I could help; but she was so charmed
with its wealth of rare ferns, that she skipped
from one point to another with an amount of
dexterity and nimbleness I had never before
given her credit for.</p>

<p>‘I do think we might collect quite a hamperful,
Helen!’ she said, kneeling down as she spoke to
dig up a root most energetically.</p>

<p>‘We had better come another day, then,’ I
responded. ‘I don’t want to be late of getting
back, so, if you don’t mind just taking a few
specimens—when Jack is with us, we can come
again.’</p>

<p>‘Now or never!’ gaily rejoined my cousin, little
imagining how soon her own words were to be
applicable to ourselves. She pounced joyfully
upon her ferns, and had collected quite a small
heap, when I suggested that we had better tell
Tom to tie the pony to a gate, and come up to
carry them down for her.</p>

<p>‘O no!’ said Cousin Susan. ‘I will carry
them myself. Do help me here just a minute,
Helen.’</p>

<p>By this time we were some distance up the
ravine; the walk was narrow and winding; we
had gone farther than even I had intended. I
bent down to give her the assistance she wanted
in raising up some lovely lichen from the trunk
of a dead tree. As I did so, my eyes wandered
some distance from where we were standing
towards a fallen tree. I fancied—perhaps it was
only fancy—I knew I was in a very nervous state,
and apt to imagine, but I fancied I saw a movement
just beyond the tree—it was within twenty
paces of us. I felt my face grow icy cold; my
veins seemed chilling; for a moment I feared I
was going to faint. Death must be something like
what I felt on that sunny day in August when I
stood in the Devonshire ravine with my unconscious
cousin. I looked again. There it was more distinctly
visible than ever—a line of drab-coloured
clothing, and presently a side-view of the most
villainous-looking countenance it was ever my
fortune to behold. If I could, without alarming
her, get my cousin to retrace her steps about ten
yards, we should have turned a corner, and then
I could tell her enough to hurry her onwards.
I knew she was nervous—more so, perhaps, than
myself; but I knew we were in imminent peril
while in such close proximity to this desperate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">{490}</span>
and, from his very escape, doubly desperate
man.</p>

<p>‘Susan,’ I said—my voice seemed so hard and
dry and strange!—‘you have passed all the best
ferns here.’</p>

<p>‘O no; I haven’t,’ said Susan joyously, approaching
two steps nearer the crouching convict.</p>

<p>‘Am I to throw these away?’ I continued,
holding out one of her best specimens, and, as
carelessly and indifferently as I could, moving
one, two, three steps nearer the corner.</p>

<p>‘No; of course not,’ she exclaimed, hurrying
towards me now. ‘Why, Helen, what are you
thinking of?’</p>

<p>I moved a few more steps on; and in a few
more, Susan and I would both be out of sight
of that fallen tree.</p>

<p>‘There is a much better one here,’ I said,
keeping my face well averted, for I felt if she
looked at me she would see its ashy paleness.</p>

<p>‘Where?’ she asked. ‘Wait a minute, and
I’ll come for it.’ To my horror, she retraced
her steps towards her heap of ferns, and carefully
counted them, whilst I waited in a state
of terror words cannot describe. But she came
at last, and I tottered with her round the fateful
corner.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be frightened,’ I said; ‘but come
quickly; ask no questions. Do as I tell you,
Susan.’</p>

<p>She paused, affrighted. ‘Good gracious, Helen,
have you seen a wild beast?’</p>

<p>‘Worse,’ I murmured. ‘Do not run, but lose
no time.’</p>

<p>I ventured to glance behind. Nothing was
visible; but every moment was precious; we must
reach the pony-trap and Tom. Once all together,
the convict would surely not venture to attack us,
and I knew that being on the high-road, alone
would in itself insure our safety. But we had not
reached it yet; a long rough narrow path had
to be traversed. If the man suspected we had
seen him, nothing would be easier than for
him to overtake us and make short work of
us. I thought of Jack, of Rose, of my happy
life. Everything seemed to float through my
mind as I half led, half dragged Susan after
me. We had gone perhaps a shade more than
half-way, when I once more turned round, in the
distance, on the path over which we had just
passed. To my unutterable consternation, I beheld
the convict hurrying towards us.</p>

<p>‘Run, Susan!’ I panted—‘run for your life!’</p>

<p>Another twist in the road hid us momentarily
from his sight; but I knew he was after us,
running now as fast as, or perhaps a good deal
faster than we were, though we were now both
of us flying along at a pace which only the
peril we were in could have enabled us to
sustain.</p>

<p>‘For your life!’ I repeated. ‘Run, Susan!’</p>

<p>I held her hand. Narrow as was the path,
we managed to struggle onwards together and to
keep ahead of our pursuer. Mercifully, we had
had a good start; and it had only been on second
thoughts, some minutes after we had disappeared,
that the man had elected to follow us. I felt if
I once let Susan’s hand go, she would be lost.
Ever and anon, she stumbled; once she nearly fell;
but she recovered herself well, and though panting
terribly, showed no signs of succumbing.</p>

<p>But he was overtaking us; I heard him coming
faster and faster, nearer and nearer. I heard him
breathing behind us, and I felt another instant
and he must be upon us.</p>

<p>‘Help!’ I shrieked.</p>

<p>‘Help!’ echoed poor exhausted Susan, in a still
shriller treble.</p>

<p>I heard an oath, awful in its profanity, hurled
at us; but the steps seemed to pause.</p>

<p>‘Help! help!’ I shrieked again.</p>

<p>We plunged forwards. I heard as in the distance
the sound of horses’ feet galloping towards
us. Another moment and we were on the high-road;
Susan speechless, her dress half torn off
her with our terrible race, her hat gone, and otherwise
in a dishevelled condition; I feeling faint and
sick—but safe—thank God! both of us quite safe—with
not only Tom, seated in the shandrydan,
staring in mute amazement at us, but with three
stalwart mounted warders, who were even then in
quest of the convict.</p>

<p>They captured him an hour afterwards, after
a terrific struggle, which was made all the more
terrible from the fact of his having possessed himself
of a knife, with which he attempted to stab the
warders.</p>

<p>Jack came back the next day; and as his
partner’s illness had assumed rather a serious
aspect, he told me he must give up Morleigh
Cottage, and we could finish our holiday at
Eastbourne or some place nearer town. ‘I never
could leave you here again, my darling,’ he said;
‘after such an escape, I can’t risk another.’ So
we all, Cousin Susan included, returned to our
cosy house in Seymour Street, and afterwards
proceeded to the seaside, where in due time Susan
and I both fully recovered from the shock we had
received in that Devonshire ravine.</p>

</div>


<h3>III. MASTER AND SERVANT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> relation of master and servant depends
entirely upon a contract of hiring and service.
If the contract is not to be fully performed within
the period of one year, it is void if not in writing;
and this necessity for a written contract is not
confined to cases where the service is intended
to be for more than one year. If a servant be
hired on Monday for the term of one year, to
commence on the following Saturday, the contract
ought to be in writing, as a verbal contract would
be void on the ground indicated above—namely,
that it was not intended to be fully performed
within one year from the date on which it was
entered into. If, however, the service was to
commence on the Monday on which the verbal
contract of hiring was entered into, no such objection
would arise.</p>

<p>Assuming that a valid contract is entered into,
there are still some peculiarities attached to certain
kinds of service, which do not affect others. Thus,
in England, both domestic servants and agricultural
labourers are usually engaged for a year;
but the former class may put an end to the
engagement at any time by giving one month’s
notice; while the latter are irrevocably bound
for the entire year, unless the hiring be determined
by mutual consent. This difference is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">{491}</span>
founded upon universal custom, which has the
force of law. Probably the custom had its origin
in early ages, and was founded upon considerations
of convenience. The work of an agricultural
labourer is distributed very unequally over
the year, being much more heavy at some seasons
than at others; and therefore it is reasonable that
a man who receives wages by the year should not
be allowed to take his money for the light season,
and leave his situation when the work is heavier.
Domestic servants, on the other hand, have their
work more evenly distributed over the entire
year, although they also have sometimes to do
more work than at other times, but not to the
same extent as agricultural labourers; and being
brought into more immediate contact with their
master’s family (especially the mistress), it might
in many cases be very unpleasant to be obliged
to carry into full effect the hiring for a whole
year. Hence, either master or mistress on the
one hand, or domestic servant on the other, may
at any time give ‘a month’s warning,’ and so dissolve
the engagement. In Scotland, domestic
servants are generally hired for a month or for
‘the term,’ which is half a year, but agricultural
labourers for a year, as in England.</p>

<p>The more highly paid class of servants, such as
managers, cashiers, clerks above the grade of
copyists, &amp;c., are generally engaged for an indefinite
term, subject to three months’ notice. Such
an engagement as this, although it may possibly
continue for several years, need not be in writing,
because it may be dissolved within the year; and
it is only when a contract which is entire and
indivisible cannot be fully performed within
that time, that writing is necessary. It is, however,
desirable that the terms of the engagement
should be in writing, for the sake of certainty
and in order to avoid misunderstanding. Copying-clerks,
journeymen, and persons occupying positions
of a similar kind, are usually subject to one
month’s notice. In all cases, the obligation as
to notice is reciprocal, and equally binding on
both parties, mutuality being essential to the
agreement. There is, however, one distinction
which has a substantial reason for its existence:
a master may pay his clerk or manager three
months’ salary, or his journeyman or copying-clerk
one month’s salary, and dismiss him immediately;
but the servant must give the proper
notice, and cannot throw up his engagement by
sacrificing salary in lieu of notice. The reason
for this is obvious: if a clerk gets his salary
without working for it, instead of working out
his notice, he is not in any way injured, but may
be benefited by the prompt dismissal; for he
may obtain an engagement elsewhere before the
time when the notice would have expired. But
it would be difficult to estimate the loss which
might be sustained by a master in consequence
of the sudden withdrawal of a confidential clerk
or manager. For any breach of contract an action
of damages will lie at the instance of either party,
and the measure of damages will be the probable
loss to the servant before he can find a new
situation, or to the master before he can find a
new servant.</p>

<p>Whenever a person is hired without any
stipulation as to notice, the engagement will be
subject to any custom which may exist in the
particular trade or business for which he was
engaged. In some branches of business, commercial
travellers claim to be engaged absolutely
by the year, and this custom has been proved and
allowed in court; a traveller obtaining a verdict
for the balance of his year’s salary, when he had
been dismissed in the middle of the year. Ordinary
labourers, engaged by the week, are only
entitled to one week’s notice; but miners are
by custom required to give, and are entitled to
receive, fourteen days’ notice.</p>

<p>Gross misconduct on the part of the servant is
in all cases a sufficient reason for dismissal
without notice; and generally, if the misconduct
be sufficient to justify this extreme course, the
wages actually earned by the offender are forfeited,
and he or she cannot recover the same by
legal proceedings. A manager who imparts his
master’s secrets to a rival in business; a cashier
who cannot account for the cash intrusted to his
care; a journeyman who recklessly destroys any
of his master’s goods—may all be summarily dismissed.
So also may any kind of servant who
persistently disobeys his master’s orders, or frequently
absents himself without leave. A female
domestic servant who without reasonable cause
stays out all night, or who is known to be guilty
of immorality, is within the same category. It
is scarcely necessary to add that any dishonest
act by a servant, such as misappropriating his or
her master’s money or goods, ought to be followed
on detection by immediate dismissal, even though
it may not be thought necessary or desirable to
prosecute the servant.</p>

<p>In the absence of any special agreement on
the subject, a servant cannot be compelled to
make good the loss occasioned by accidental
breakages; and any deduction from the salary or
wages earned in respect of such breakages would
be illegal, unless the master were to establish a
claim for reparation in respect of fault or gross
negligence; just as in the case of a lawyer or a
doctor who has bungled the duty intrusted to
him through want of skill or due care.</p>

<p>The death of the master terminates the contract.
In England, the servant may be paid wages up
to the time of his master’s death, if the executors
do not retain his services, which would amount
to a new hiring so far as relates to notice; but
in Scotland he is entitled to be paid wages and
board-wages up to the end of his engagement,
unless a new situation should in the meantime
be procured for him either by himself or the
executors. He is at anyrate entitled to be kept
free from loss, because he was ready to fulfil his
part of the contract.</p>

<p>On the bankruptcy of the master, each clerk
or servant, labourer or workman—if the assets
be sufficient—is entitled to be paid in full the
salary or wages due to him in respect of services
rendered to the bankrupt during four months
before the date of the receiving order, if the
amount do not exceed fifty pounds, before any
dividend is paid to ordinary creditors. For
any excess, the servant must rank against
his master’s estate as an ordinary creditor,
with whom he will rank for dividend thereon.
This right of priority is, however, subject to the
right of the landlord to distrain for the rent due,
not exceeding a twelvemonth, and is shared with
the collectors of rates and taxes within certain
specified limits. If the net amount of assets in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">{492}</span>
hand, after paying expenses, should be insufficient
to cover the preferential payments, the money
must be divided among the parties entitled, by
way of preferential dividend. In Scotland, the
farm-servant’s claim for wages is preferable to the
landlord’s claim for rent.</p>

<p>A master is liable for any damage done to the
property of strangers by his servant in the course
of his ordinary employment, but not otherwise.
For example: a groom who is sent out by his
master with a horse and carriage, and drives so
negligently as to injure another person’s horse
or carriage, renders his master liable to an action
for damages. An engine-driver who disregards
a danger-signal, and causes a collision, involves
the Railway Company in a liability for reparation
to every passenger who may be injured. But a
master is not liable if the servant act beyond the
scope of his employment; if, for example, the
groom were accidentally to wound a passer-by
with the gamekeeper’s gun, or even if the gamekeeper
himself were voluntarily to wound a
poacher, unless it were proved that he was actually
ordered by his master to do it.</p>

<p>Before January 1, 1881, a master was not
liable to an action for damages in respect of any
injury sustained by any person employed by
him through the negligence of a fellow-servant;
though he might be held responsible if the
accident which caused the injury were caused
by his own negligence. But the law has been
altered, and a workman is now entitled to compensation
for accidental injury sustained by
reason of the negligence of any foreman or
superintendent in the service of his employer;
or of any person whose orders the workman was
bound to obey; or by reason of anything done in
compliance with the rules or bylaws of the
employer, or in obedience to particular instructions
given by any person duly authorised for
that purpose: or in the case of railway servants,
by reason of the negligence of any signalman,
pointsman, engine-driver, &amp;c. But the right to
compensation is not to arise in case the workman
knew of the negligence which caused the injury,
and failed to give notice to the employer or some
person superior to himself in the service of the
employer; nor if the rules or bylaws from the
observance of which the accident arose had been
approved by the proper department of the
government; neither would a workman who by
his own negligence had contributed to the accident
be entitled to compensation: the common-law
rule as to contributory negligence being
applicable. In case of any accident which is
within the provisions of the Act, notice of the
injury must be given to the employer within
six weeks, and any action must be commenced
within six months after the occurrence of the
accident; or in case of death, proceedings must
be taken within twelve months from the date
of death. The compensation must not exceed in
amount three years’ earnings; and the action
must in England be brought in the County
Court; in Scotland in the Sheriff Court; and in
Ireland in the Civil Bill Court; the proceedings
in each case being removable into a superior
court at the instance of either party. The benefits
of the Act do not extend to domestic or menial
servants, but are available for railway servants,
labourers agricultural and general, journeymen,
artificers, handicraftsmen, and persons otherwise
engaged in manual labour.</p>

<p>In case of the illness of a servant—unless such
illness be caused by his or her own misconduct—the
master cannot legally refuse to pay the wages
which may accrue during the time of such illness;
but the service may be terminated by notice in
the usual way; the principle being that no man
can be held accountable for what is beyond his
own control. The servant being willing to do his
duty, but rendered unable to do so by circumstances
beyond his own control, he must not be
punished for such inability by being deprived
of his wages. A master is only liable to pay his
servant’s medical attendant when the master has
employed him, but not when the doctor is
employed by the servant himself.</p>

<p>A master may bring an action against a stranger
for any injury done to his servant, whereby he
(the master) suffers loss or inconvenience, or for
enticing his servant away, and inducing him to
neglect or refuse to fulfil his engagement.</p>

<p>When a servant applies to any person for a
new engagement, it is usual for him to refer to
his previous master for a character, as it would
be objectionable for a stranger to be employed
without some means of knowing whether he was
competent and respectable. In answering inquiries
as to character and ability, it is necessary
to be very careful to say neither more nor less
than the exact truth. If an undeserved bad
character be given, the servant may recover
damages, on establishing malice and want of probable
cause, in an action for libel or slander,
according to the mode in which the character
was given, in writing or verbally. On the other
hand, suppression of unfavourable facts may have
still more serious consequences. If a servant be
known to be dishonest, and his master ventures
to recommend him as trustworthy, he will render
himself liable to make good any loss occasioned by
subsequent acts of dishonesty which may be committed
by the servant in his new situation, and
which without such recommendation could not
have been committed. When nothing favourable
can be said, the safest way is to decline to answer
any inquiries on the subject. But it would be
unfair to adopt this course without adequate
cause, for such refusal would inevitably be construed
as equivalent to giving the servant a bad
character, and would frequently prove an obstacle
to his obtaining another situation.</p>

heroine? Are there any, and where are they?
Who shall tell us? Can the novelists? For the
most part, no. The ordinary sort of fiction is
full of ambitious flecks and flaws; how can it
know and describe the most delicate and intricate,
the most minutely beautiful of human characters?
There is a novel in which the hero exclaims
pathetically that he was ‘a Pariah’ until he
married. Could the inventor of the Pariah
invent anything but a heroine to match him?
The fiction that excels in the highest qualities
falls short here. The best describer of life,
even if his conception of this character be
perfectly just, must be content with merely
hinting it, for his space has limits. Instead
of describing in half a page the colour of eyes,
hair, and dress, and afterwards ten adventures
and two dozen conversations, he could hardly
be expected to write for one character a whole
shelf of detailed volumes, and to gather his notes
with the minuteness of a census-taker.</p>

<p>Let us look elsewhere. Several women have
passed the old turnstile to public life, and got in
somehow on men’s tickets. Their insignificant
sisters peep over the wall, and observe that men
who outside were the soul of chivalry, begin to
elbow the ladies within, and ungallantly assert in
self-defence that the ladies have elbows too. The
insignificant sisters will not enter; but if they
tried to reason about it, they would be ‘stumped
out’ in a moment by the others on the platforms
inside. ‘When I hear a woman use intellectual
arguments, I am dismayed,’ says a wise thinker
from beyond the Atlantic; and the insignificant
crowd aforesaid and the majority of the world
agree with him in this; and those outside the
wall find out all at once that a woman’s unreasoning
nature is no insignificant charm. ‘Her best
reason, as it is the world’s best, is the inspiration
of a pure and believing heart. She is happiest
when she devotes herself, obedient to her patient
and unselfish nature, to some loved being or high
cause; and glory itself, says Madame de Staël,
would be for her only a splendid mourning-suit
for happiness denied.’</p>

<p>Shall we turn from the platforms, and look to
intellectual culture? We see at the outset that it
cannot be necessary to heroism; for all human
nature’s highest prizes are open to all, and great
intellectual culture belongs to the few. Besides,
there can be such a thing as learning too much,
and knowing nothing worth knowing. In America,
where life is lived double-quick, and where
every product from a continent downwards is
of the largest size, there are crops of overtaught
girlhood ripe already for our inspection. Women
of the middle classes there can discuss the nebular
hypothesis or the binomial theory, as ours talk
of lacework and the baby. Mr Hudson, in his
recent <i>Scamper through America</i>, declares that to
converse in the railway cars with ladies returning
from Conventions and Conferences was a genuine
pleasure, an intellectual treat. But he adds, that
though one could revere them, almost worship
them, to love them was out of the question.
‘Practical passionless creatures, they seemed to
constitute a third sex. Where were the girls?
We never saw them. We did meet with young
ladies of twelve and thirteen, with jewel-laden
fingers, and with vocabularies of ponderous dictionary
words; but, like their mothers and elder
sisters, they were such superior beings, that one
longed for a lassie that was not so very clever—one
who had something yet unlearned that she
could ask a fellow to tell her about.’</p>

<p>We have failed in the novels, on the platforms,
and at the learned Conferences. Shall we carry
our search to the haunts of human suffering
next? There are hundreds of women, banded
together or working singly, to whom every form
of sorrow and helplessness is an attraction. They
do not deal in dry statistical philanthropy, but in
loving compassion. They are not ‘women with
a mission,’ because the woman with a mission
flaunts it before the world, and gets more or less
in everybody’s way; but these desire to remain
unknown, never counting the debt humanity owes
to them. The wounded soldier on the battlefield
knows them well enough; and the criminal in
prison; and the sick, the poor, the aged, the
young children. Sacrificing a whole life to
the common good, they are heroines; it is
beyond doubt. But not the heroines we seek,
whose sphere is to be something more homely,
easy, and attainable for all. However, these
women, whose lives are compassion, have given
a light upon the track. It dawns upon us, that
in womanly heroism, self-sacrifice is the essence,
and hiddenness marks it genuine.</p>

<p>Far different is the typical woman with a
mission, whose type, dashed off with a few strokes
by the pen of Dickens, flits across our memory
from <i>Bleak House</i>, and provokes a sigh and a
smile. Again, Mrs Jellyby, with her dress laced
anyhow like the lattice of a summer-house, is
writing in a room full of disorder, with her
philanthropic eye fixed upon the savages of
Borrioboola, South Africa, while her own little
boy is outside, kicking and howling, with his
head stuck between the area railings. Again,
Mr Jellyby employs his evenings in leaning his
head feebly against the wall; and when poor
Caddy is married, we hear him giving her all
he has to give—the beseeching advice: ‘My
dear, never have a mission!’</p>

<p>Even Mrs Jellyby may help us in our search,
by sending us flying in the opposite direction.
We have had light on our path—hiddenness is
the seal, and unselfishness is the essence, and we
are searching for the heroines of home. Their
distinction does not depend, as in fiction, upon
adventures, lovers, or beauty. If it did, they
could be heroines only till the end of youth and
volume three; but in the real world they shall
be heroines not only till the time of gray hairs
and careworn brow, but for ever and a day.</p>

<p>There is nothing in creation more beautiful
than a true heroine, and nothing so hard to find.
Not that they are scarce. They crowd the world
as daisies dot the summer fields. But they are
hidden, and hidden precisely where a thing
wanted is most unlikely to be found—too close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">{494}</span>
to us, just straight before our eyes. Not in the
world of romance, or in the crush of public
life, or in the clear cold air of science; but
in the narrow lane where we started, in the
monotonous routine of common daily life, that
seems to be hedged in from all interest—there
are the heroines to be found. Their
heroism is made up of trivial details, the shabby
atoms of uneventful life. If it be objected
that the heroic means something greatly above
the ordinary level, we would answer, that their
whole life is above the level; that the essence
of heroism—sacrifice—has become to them an
unconsciously acting second nature, and that
all that is life-long is surely great. But sometimes
trivial incidents can become in themselves
heroic. Whoever heard in a novel of heroism
with a crushed thumb? All the finest things
are true. It is told of the late Viscountess
Beaconsfield, that on the night of an important
speech by her husband, then Mr Disraeli, when
they were seated in the carriage together to drive
to the House of Commons, the servant closing
the door, crushed her thumb. She uttered no
cry, left the bruise untouched, and acted and
spoke as if she was at ease. Hours after, when
she descended from the Ladies’ Gallery, he discovered
the agony she had been enduring, in
order not to spoil his speech; and in after-years,
when the Viscountess was dead, he still
told the touching little story in her praise.</p>

<p>But to return to our heroines of commonplace
life. Their greatness does not even need striking
incidents. Their worth makes precious those
trivial atoms of which life is composed, and what
began as an unpretending patchwork, ends as a
complete and precious picture, like the splendid
mosaics of Venice or Rome. This is why one
might defy the first of novelists to describe the
loveliness of such a life; its daily parts are positively
too small to pick up.</p>

<p>For each one of us there is some face enshrined
in memory, whose influence is lofty as an
inspiration, whose power is a living power,
whose love has been stronger than death, and
will light an upward path for us even to life’s
end. Why is all this but because she whom
we loved was a heroine? And what were her
characteristics? One answer will serve for all—Tenderness,
gentleness, self-forgetfulness, suffering.
The last characteristic may not be universal,
like the rest. But the highest love can
only exist where suffering has touched the object
loved. It is one of the compensations for the
manifold sorrow of this world of ours. The fire
of trial seems to light up every beauty and attraction.
The life that not only loved much but
suffered much has a royal right of influence as
long as memory lasts—an influence which cannot
belong to any life which suffering has not
crowned.</p>

<p>Now we have sketched our heroine, easily
recognisable, but herself never dreaming or caring
to think that she is one, or her glory would be
frail as a bubble. The poorest woman knitting
on her cottage threshold can have this glory for
her own; for there is no true-hearted woman,
rich or poor, who cannot walk her simple life
lovingly enough to leave enshrined for others,
as a living influence, such a memory as we have
described. And what sceptre has so sweet a
power as that—an immortal influence through
the hearts we have loved most? Compared with
this, what is fame but an echo, and what is the
heroism of romance but an unreal shadow!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ARMY_SCHOOLS">ARMY SCHOOLS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> valuable advantages these institutions offer
to soldiers and their children will, we trust, be
evident from the perusal of the following short
account of their organisation. With regard to
children, these schools will soon have little to do;
for the new system of short service promises to
do away almost entirely with the married soldier.
A soldier is not allowed to marry till he has
served seven years, subject to certain qualifications
of good conduct; but as the great majority
of men are passed into the Reserve before
they reach that length of service, the proportion
of married soldiers is very small, and rapidly
becoming more and more reduced in number.
It is rather with the men themselves, therefore,
that the military schoolmaster and his assistants
have now principally to deal.</p>

<p>Every regiment or depôt has its school. The
schoolmasters are trained at Chelsea; and though
non-combatants, they are subject to the usual
army regulations. They now rank as warrant-officers,
and, on the whole, are an able and estimable
body of men. Occasionally, educated and
promising young soldiers are selected from the
ranks and sent to the training college to qualify
as schoolmasters. Their number is, however, very
limited; the great majority of the schoolmasters
enter the army through the college, joining it as
civilians; consequently, a schoolmaster cannot be
reduced to the ranks. If he misconduct himself
seriously, he is liable to be tried by court-martial
and dismissed. Such cases are very rare. The
army schoolmaster retires with a pension on
attaining twenty-one years’ service, though, under
certain conditions, it is possible for him to prolong
his engagement. If of more than ordinary
ability, he is often promoted to the higher rank
and more important position of Sub-inspector of
Army Schools.</p>

<p>Assistants are allowed in these schools according
to the numbers in attendance at them. There
is usually one school-assistant to about every
twenty men or children attending. In depôts,
where the soldiers are mostly recruits, the
attendance is often very large, with a correspondingly
increased number of assistants. The
latter are picked out from among the better-educated
men in a regiment; they receive extra
pay, and are exempt from the ordinary drill
and duty of the rank and file, giving their time
and attention to the working of the school and
the details connected with it. Many well-educated
men, who are not otherwise well suited
for non-commissioned officers, are employed in
this way in imparting instruction to their more
illiterate comrades.</p>

<p>Every recruit on joining a depôt has to attend
school until he satisfies an examiner—sub-inspector—of
his familiarity with certain elementary
subjects. Examinations for this purpose are held
at intervals. There are four classes of certificates
granted to candidates on passing the necessary
examinations. Supposing a man to be competent
to pass the fourth or lowest standard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">{495}</span>
he becomes exempt from further school attendance.
But if ambitious of being made a non-commissioned
officer, or of securing one of the
other good berths, of which there are many open
to intelligent men, it is advisable for him to
hold on till he gains a higher certificate. For
example, to be promoted to the rank of corporal,
the aspirant must be in possession of a third-class
certificate; to attain to a sergeant’s position, he
must have one of the second class. Thus, a considerable
proportion of the men in a regiment
are kept under instruction; and as soon as one
batch has been passed out of the school, other
candidates appear. A few unfortunates, entirely
destitute of education when they enlist, are often
long in obtaining the desired certificates. After a
year or two’s attendance, they are probably dismissed
from school as ‘useless.’ Such hopeless
ignoramuses—happily not so numerous now as
formerly—are a bugbear to the school staff:
they soon cease to make any attempt to learn,
and are simply in the way of the more intelligent
or persevering men. Of course, to such,
the school-work is a species of punishment. But
let us glance at the quantity and quality of the
learning implied in obtaining the certificates.</p>

<p>To satisfy the examiner, the entirely uncultured
youth has in the first place to set himself
resolutely to learn to read. Then he must be
able to write to the extent of transcribing a few
lines from a book. With the mysteries of the
four elementary rules of arithmetic he must
display a tolerably intimate acquaintance. To
men who can already read and write, the latter
does not prove an insuperable obstacle. Having
furnished a moderately good ‘paper’ on these
not very exacting subjects, he in a few days
receives his fourth-class certificate, and leaves
the school in triumph. But if he aspires to a
third-class certificate, a man of this kind has
yet much to do. As a matter of fact, very
few attempt more from mere love of self-improvement;
an eye to advancement in the
ranks acts as the stimulus to further study.
Writing fairly well to dictation is a part of this
next higher step, and often proves a serious difficulty.
Arithmetic will include the compound
rules and reduction; and on a man passing this
standard, a third-class certificate is granted. The
possession of this qualifies the holder for the
rank of corporal. But to the corporal, further
promotion is necessary. No corporal would go
to so much trouble, besides having to perform
the ordinary duty attached to his rank in
regimental affairs, except as a step towards
the coveted chevrons of the sergeant. To
attain sergeant’s rank may be taken as the
aim and ambition of all corporals; and the
latter are the men who, as we have seen,
try to get the third-class certificates. But a
sergeant must, by the regulations, have a
second-class certificate. To the comparatively
untutored corporal, this object entails his continued
use of the school, and an increased
demand of the schoolmaster’s instruction. In
short, to a man whose education has been more
or less neglected in early youth, this second-class
test is a pretty stiff one; it requires a
considerable amount of application for a time
before he can present himself for examination
with a reasonable chance of passing. He must
be able to write fluently and correctly a moderately
difficult passage to dictation; and take
down military orders with due care to arrangement
and spelling. A long list of terms connected
with military matters—such as ‘commissariat,’
‘aide-de-camp,’ ‘manœuvre’—has to be
written and spelt correctly. The arithmetical
part of the examination consists of the ordinary
rules as far as and including decimals. Besides,
he must be able to work out a debt and
credit account, a military savings-bank account,
and a mess account. Withal, he must read
with fluency, and write a good legible hand.
Such is the necessary scholastic attainment of
the modern sergeant. The ordeal would probably
have terrified his predecessors of a quarter of
a century ago.</p>

<p>There remains still the certificate of the First
class. This is obtained by a comparatively
small number of men. It enters into details
which would be, to many, insurmountable
difficulties; and as the possession of it is not
compulsory for any non-commissioned rank, it
is not much sought after. A few of the originally
better-educated men do, however, go in for
it. As a passport to the higher grades of clerkships,
or even to eventual commissions, it is
desirable. The examination includes an extra
subject, such as a language, or geometry; the
whole of arithmetic; and a searching test as to
spelling and composition.</p>

<p>The reader will see that, from the above
description, the second-class certificate is the
important one to possess. Men having got it,
are available for all the higher kinds of non-commissioned
officers, as colour-sergeants, sergeant-majors,
&amp;c. The work of preparing men
for this is perhaps a very important part of the
business of the school, and is generally undertaken
mainly by the schoolmaster himself.</p>

<p>In an army school the men are divided into
classes according to their several abilities or stages
of advancement. A special class is usually composed
of men preparing themselves for the next
examination for sergeants; another lot looking
forward to being made corporals are engaged
in the necessary work for third-class certificates.
Then there are still more elementary classes for
men trying to get themselves exempted from
school attendance by passing the fourth class;
and lastly, are the complete ‘ignoramuses’ who
are labouring at the alphabet or assiduously
making pot-hooks. The duration of the daily
attendance is from an hour to an hour and
a half; but other duties frequently break in
upon this, and men are not able to be present
every successive day. As attendance is compulsory,
the men are paraded and marched
to school as for any other duty; but the
room is open in the evening for those anxious
to push on with their work—the latter being,
so to speak, volunteers, and nearly all non-commissioned
officers. From this it will be seen
that men really desirous of picking up a serviceable
education have ample opportunity of doing
so, especially when we consider the large share
of spare time which the soldier has in ordinary
circumstances on his hands.</p>

<p>All the schools are furnished with maps,
books, and everything essential for carrying on
their work. Where there are children, they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">{496}</span>
supplied with these requisites. Children, however,
from being at one time the more important,
have now become a secondary element in army
schools. The present writer was connected with
a school having an average attendance of two
hundred men, but no children. This was in a
depôt, and the men were almost without exception
recruits. A small number of children in barracks
were sent out to the Board School, leaving
the school staff to devote its whole attention
to the adults. At one time several regiments
would have been required to furnish such a
numerously attended school as the above, when
recruits came in at the rate of perhaps about
twenty annually. But short service has filled
regiments up with recruits, or at least with
very young soldiers, which, together with other
circumstances, has given more ample employment
to the schoolmaster. If we compare the number
of recruits who join a regiment with that of
the certificates of education granted in the same
corps, we speedily find that the school department
has not been asleep; and especially is this
the case when we consider what is the educational
standard of most men who enlist. We
hear a good deal from time to time concerning
the superior class of men that now seek to
enter the army; but, practically, from an
educational point of view, recruits are not so
very different from what we have seen for
many years past. It will yet be long before
the army schools are abolished.</p>

<p>Among some statistics, we lately noticed some
figures relating to the standard of education of
soldiers. In this statement, a large percentage—fifty-seven
per cent. of the whole rank and
file—was set down as of ‘superior education.’
This probably referred to the men in possession
of the two highest kinds of certificates, as
holders of the third class could hardly be
included under such a heading. The reader
may perhaps be inclined to smile at the use
of such a high-sounding term; though that
such a large proportion of the ranks are educated
even to this degree appears on the whole
to be very creditable indeed. It certainly offers
a marked contrast to the state of affairs at no
very remote period.</p>

</div>


<p>This interesting and important experiment has
just been tried with great success at the Park
Pit Ocean Collieries, South Wales. The arrangement
consists of a number of Swan incandescent
lamps distributed throughout the workings, both
under and above ground, in the workshops and
engine-houses. The bottom of the mine is thus
admirably lighted, and the whole of the workings
as far as the main engine roads. The power is
supplied by a six horse-power Marshall engine,
fitted with Hartnell’s patent automatic expansion
gear, driving a Crompton-Bürgin self-regulating
dynamo.</p>

<p>We believe we are correct in stating that this
is the first attempt to illuminate the whole of
the interior of a colliery pit, and its workings
and offices, by this useful medium; and it is
impossible to over-estimate the value of an incandescent
light, and yet one of extraordinary brilliancy,
in such a place as a coal-mine, subject
to the escape of gases which are liable at any
moment, on coming in contact with an unprotected
flame, to occasion an explosion involving
terrible and deplorable consequences. Now, this
is one source of danger which the use of
this system of lighting prevents; and if this is
found to succeed, it is to be hoped that it may
be adopted in all underground works, where the
advantage of a brilliant light to work by is
recognised; a marvellous contrast to the safe
but gloomy and light-obstructing ‘Davy.’ There
can really be no reason why this plan should
not be universally applied to mines, unless the
objection may be on the score of expense, for
when once the necessary driving-machinery is
built, the rest is simple enough, and the advantages
almost untold.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
